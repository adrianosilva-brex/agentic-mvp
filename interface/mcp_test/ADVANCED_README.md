# Advanced MCP Implementation with SQLite Database

This advanced MCP implementation demonstrates how LLMs can interact with databases through SQL queries, showing the complete thinking process.

## 🆕 New Features

- **SQLite Database**: Weather, cities, and travel destination data
- **SQL Query Tool**: LLM can write and execute SQL queries
- **Thinking Process**: See exactly how the LLM thinks and makes decisions
- **Complex Queries**: Join tables, aggregate data, filter results
- **Safety**: SQL injection protection, read-only queries

## 📁 Files

### Core Implementation
- `database.py` - SQLite database setup with sample data
- `advanced_mcp_server.py` - MCP server with SQL query tools
- `advanced_mcp_client.py` - Client with thinking process display
- `test_advanced_mcp.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Database Schema
```sql
cities (id, name, country, state, latitude, longitude, population, timezone)
weather_data (id, city_id, date, temperature_celsius, humidity, precipitation_mm, wind_speed_kmh, condition)
travel_destinations (id, city_id, category, attraction_name, description, rating, cost_level)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
cd /Users/adriano.silva/exp-trip/trip-mvp/interface/mcp_test
python database.py
```

### 2. Start Advanced MCP Server
```bash
python advanced_mcp_server.py
```
Server runs on `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Use Interactive CLI
```bash
python advanced_mcp_client.py
```

## 🎯 Example Interactions

### Simple Weather Query
```
🔍 Ask: "What's the weather like in Tokyo recently?"

🤔 LLM Thinking Process:
   👤 User asks: What's the weather like in Tokyo recently?
   🤔 Sending question to LLM with database tools...
   🔧 LLM decided to use tool: query_weather_database
   ⚡ Executing tool: query_weather_database
   📝 Query: SELECT c.name, w.date, w.temperature_celsius, w.condition, w.humidity 
            FROM cities c JOIN weather_data w ON c.id = w.city_id 
            WHERE c.name = 'Tokyo' ORDER BY w.date DESC LIMIT 7
   💭 Purpose: Get recent weather data for Tokyo
   🗃️ SQL query executed
   📊 Found 7 rows
   🤔 Sending tool results back to LLM for final response...
   🤖 Final response generated

🤖 Response: Based on the recent weather data for Tokyo, here's what I found:
Tokyo has been experiencing mild autumn weather with temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C...
```

### Complex Comparison Query
```
🔍 Ask: "Compare humidity levels between New York and London"

🤔 LLM generates SQL to compare cities:
SELECT c.name, AVG(w.humidity) as avg_humidity, MIN(w.humidity) as min_humidity, MAX(w.humidity) as max_humidity
FROM cities c JOIN weather_data w ON c.id = w.city_id 
WHERE c.name IN ('New York', 'London') 
GROUP BY c.name
```

### Travel + Weather Query
```
🔍 Ask: "Show me cities with recent rain and their top attractions"

🤔 LLM creates complex join:
SELECT DISTINCT c.name, c.country, td.attraction_name, td.rating, AVG(w.precipitation_mm) as avg_rain
FROM cities c 
JOIN weather_data w ON c.id = w.city_id 
JOIN travel_destinations td ON c.id = td.city_id
WHERE w.precipitation_mm > 0 AND w.date >= date('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY c.name, td.attraction_name
ORDER BY td.rating DESC, avg_rain DESC
```

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### 1. `query_weather_database`
Execute custom SQL queries on the database
```json
{
  "sql_query": "SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population > 10000000",
  "explanation": "Find cities with over 10 million people"
}
```

### 2. `get_database_schema`
Get information about tables and columns
```json
{
  "table_name": "weather_data"  // optional
}
```

### 3. `suggest_sql_query`
Get SQL suggestions based on natural language
```json
{
  "description": "show me rainy cities"
}
```

### 4. `get_weather_summary`
Quick weather summary for a city
```json
{
  "city_name": "Paris",
  "days": 7
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
python test_advanced_mcp.py
```

### Test Individual Components
```bash
# Test database only
python database.py

# Test server API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool_name": "query_weather_database",
    "parameters": {
      "sql_query": "SELECT name, country FROM cities LIMIT 3",
      "explanation": "Get 3 cities"
    }
  }'
```

## 🎨 CLI Features
